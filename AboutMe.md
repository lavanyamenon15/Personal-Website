Hello! I'm Lavanya, a fourth year student at The University of British Columbia pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Science (BSc) majoring in Computer Science. I am a passionate and driven person who consistently strives to learn more about various facets of computer science as well as their applications. In the past, I have worked with things like back-end database development, full-stack bug resolution, algorithmic problem solving, and front-end UI building. 

Along with my technical skills, I am also a very creative and artistic person! I love painting, writing, film, and many other artistic endeavours. I find that I often draw on the skills I have developed through my engagement with soft sciences when approaching or visualizing technical problems or tasks at hand. 

Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in connecting to have a friendly chat or to discuss any opportunities!
