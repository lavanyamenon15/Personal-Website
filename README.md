# Personal-Website

Hello! I'm Lavanya, a fourth year student at The University of British Columbia pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Science (BSc) majoring in Computer Science. I am a passionate and driven person who consistently strives to learn more about various facets of computer science as well as their applications. In the past, I have worked with things like back-end database development, full-stack bug resolution, algorithmic problem solving, and front-end UI building.

Along with my technical skills, I am also a very creative and artistic person! I love painting, writing, film, and many other artistic endeavours. I find that I often draw on the skills I have developed through my engagement with soft sciences when approaching or visualizing technical problems or tasks at hand. 

I am currently on a Co-op work term with Claribase as a Database Developer. Claribase is an Airtable Consulting Company that creates bespoke and scalable database and automation solutions for a variety of clients. 

Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in connecting to have a friendly chat or to discuss any opportunities!
